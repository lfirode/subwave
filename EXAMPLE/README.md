# SUBWAVE

Simple example of Subspace detection for two clusters and 4 stations. 

The user defines the detection day. The continuous data recorded at the different stations on this day are directly downloaded and a file containing the statistic values exceeding the threshold value (as well as the associated detection time, cluster number and threshold value) is given as output.
